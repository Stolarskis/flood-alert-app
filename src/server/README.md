Thanks to mingrammer for creating a great example that I based this project off.

After a friend of mine had some problems running asterisk-ctl on his computer. I realized what this app really needed was a "Front-End". I use that term cautiously
because while I know I need to create a frontend eventually. I would much rather have a simple rest server to start out with.
